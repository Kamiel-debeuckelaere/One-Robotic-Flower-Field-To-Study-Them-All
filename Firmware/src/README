In this folder, there are 4 possible sourcefiles containing a slightly different program. 

!! you can only use one source file at once, so delete the ones you don't need before opening the 'firmware' folder in e.g., Visual Studio Code !!
 
 1) 'main.cpp' has automatic refilling and a refill gap (that can be chosen from the NodeRed dashboard website) after a visit,
     keep in mind you have to slect a refill gap in orde to have the flower working properly!
 
 2) 'main_autoRefillOnly.cpp' only has the automatic refilling (that can be chosen from the NodeRed dashboard website)

 3) 'main_no_sending.cpp' can be selected if you want to use the robotic flower for refilling only

 4) 'main_RFID_no_RX_sending.cpp' can be selected when you combine the flowers with the Microsensys RFID system.
     The RFID radio waves will make the flowers deaf, meaning they cannot receive instructions anymore, so in this firmware version,
     when the flower is put to sleep, it will keep sending data but not expecting an answer. Note that you will have to put the flowers
     to sleep from the dashboard website before switching on the RFID readers.
