In this folder, there are 2 possible sourcefiles containing a slightly different program. 

!! you can only use one of the 2 at once, so delete the one you don't need before opening the 'firmware' folder in e.g., Visual Studio Code !!
 
 1) 'main.cpp' has automatic refilling and a refill gap (that can be chosen from the NodeRed dashboard website) after a visit
 
 2) 'main_standardRefilling.cpp' only has the automatic refilling (that can be chosen from the NodeRed dashboard website)
