This directory contains 2 flows in JSON format that can be imported in Node-RED.
More information on how to import a flow: https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export

These flows construct the dashboard website (see figure) and construct the CSV files of incoming data.

It is necessary to add the folowing modules to the palette:
- node-red-contrib-fs
- node-red-dashboard
- node-red-node-tail



The 'File Logger Flow' is only needed once per robotic flower field system.
-> change path to folder where CSV should be stored (nodes: 'filename generator', 'file-lister', 'init' and 'reset')


The 'Flower Flow' is needed for every seperate robotic flower in the system
-> change topic so it contains the right device and app name!
-> update server security settings in downlink and uplink node for each flower


Screenshots of dashboard website
The user interface of the frontend application with the different tabs opened. 
For example, in the 'battery' tab an overview of all the robotic flowers in use can be seen with the time of the last update (last received message), 
the battery voltage, and a graph of the voltage decline in function of time.
