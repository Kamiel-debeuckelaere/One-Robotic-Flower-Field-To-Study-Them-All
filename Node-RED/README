This directory contains 2 flows in JSON format that can be imported in Node-RED.
More information on how to import a flow: https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export

The 'File Logger Flow' is only needed once per robotic flower field system.
The 'Flower Flow' is needed for every seperate robotic flower in the system (change topic so it contains the right device name!)
