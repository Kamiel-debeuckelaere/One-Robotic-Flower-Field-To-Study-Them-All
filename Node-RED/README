This directory contains 2 flows in JSON format that can be imported in Node-RED.
More information on how to import a flow: https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/workspace/import-export

It will be needed to add the folowing nodes to the palette:
- node-red-contrib-fs
- node-red-dashboard
- node-red-node-tail
- node-red-node-rbe



The 'File Logger Flow' is only needed once per robotic flower field system.
-> change path to folder where CSV should be stored (nodes: 'filename generator', 'file-lister', 'init' and 'reset')


The 'Flower Flow' is needed for every seperate robotic flower in the system
-> change topic so it contains the right device and app name!
-> update server security settings in downlink and uplink node for each flower
