Dear visitor

In this repository you can find 4 folders, each containing different information and files to construct robotic flowers.
- 3D-design files
- Firmware to put on the arduino (only use one of the two included .cpp files!)
- Node-RED flows
- PCB-design files

We bundled a lot of information in the user manual, including instructions for construction and use of the robotic flower. 
I hope you can find everything you need, if not, don't hesitate to ask!

Kind regards,
Kamiel
