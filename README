Dear visitor

In this repository you can find 4 folders, each containing different information and files to construct robotic flowers.
- 3D-design files
- Firmware to put on the arduino
- Node-RED flows
- PCB-design files

I hope you can find everything you need, if not, don't hesitate to ask me.

Kind regards,
Kamiel
